                                    the same time, turns on the AC, and puts enormous strain on the power grid, putting the
                                    entire area at risk of blackouts. This strain is only increasing with time. To combat this,
                                    we designed and launched a product designed to convince people to use less energy during
                                    times of peak demand, with behavioral psychology, financial incentive, and mass
                                    communication. It worked wonders in its pilot phase and has since been launched for a
                                    variety of utilities across the world. It has spawned related demand response products,
                                    including a version that accomplishes the same goal without financial incentive.

                                    In the early days of the Outbound Platform, we only had coarse-grained introspection into
                                    the actual progress of products being executed on the platform. We did not know what was
                                    happening at the level of individual communications (e.g. emails, text messages), although
                                    we knew of an increasing variety of use cases for that information. We designed a dataset
                                    and suite of APIs for working with communication history, built a distributed logging system
                                    for capturing data at runtime, developed a fleet of services for composing useful
                                    projections of the dataset, and provided libraries to allow other teams to build their own

                                    Related to our need for more granular communication history, the young Outbound Platform
                                    needed improved operational tooling to help ramp up a half dozen teams and a couple of
                                    dozen products onto the platform at a rapid pace. Using communication history as our chief
                                    dataset, we built a few services to project that data in ways useful for monitoring and
                                    troubleshooting. Layered on top of that, we built a service for anomaly detection
                                    and business-rule alerting, a web app for real-time monitoring and administration, and a
                                    system for fine-grained operation, including execution control, blocking, and scheduling.
                                    Adjacent to this we built a system for operational//infrastructural alerting.

                                    Targeted tips are one of the primary ways that we drive energy efficiency. The previous
                                    system for storing, exposing, and updating tip content had become a significant maintenance
                                    burden, impacted product performance, and reduced program flexibility for our clients. We
                                    decided to perform an overhaul of the entire system, piece by piece. We built a new service

                                    After some organizational change brought together both the Outbound Platform team and a
                                    variety of teams building atop the platform, a new organization arose with 40 engineers
                                    across 6 teams, little working familiarity, a new charter and goals, and a new stack for
                                    many. To help bootstrap our organization with a shared vision and reduced developer
                                    friction, I drafted, published, evangelized, and socialized a new set of development

                                    One of the most compelling visualizations that we give to people is a disaggregation of
                                    their energy usage: how much is used on cooling, lighting, appliances, and so forth. To
                                    tailor our disaggregation process when it was still fresh and improve accuracy, we
                                    developed a questionnaire that people could take through their utility's Opower web portal
                                    to provide another relevant set of inputs to the algorithm. We integrated this with other
                                    inputs, including signals from actual usage data, to display an immediate disaggregation
                                    breakdown. We then used this to target more relevant tips, empowering steps towards energy
                                    efficiency. One of the earliest Opower products that put together our full story. It has

                                    Not every type of outbound content that Opower sends or that utilities want to send is a
                                    long-term, polished product. Sometimes utilities want to send out one-off communications or
                                    experimental types of content to validate ideas. The Outbound Platform, powerful and
                                    expressive as it is, is not ideal for this kind of quick idea validation. We embarked on a
                                    project to develop an SDK with a smaller footprint, more rapid development, and a quicker
                                    loop through generation, delivery, and feedback. We successfully launched a pair of
                                    experimental products on this SDK before an organizational pivot ended the
                                    project. We learned much, though, and have since repurposed some artifacts for our use.
