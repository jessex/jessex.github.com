<h2>I am Joshua, a person with thoughts, ambitions and principles.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
<p>Some of the things that roll around the recesses of my mind are theories of consciousness, physics of the universe, philosophies of everything, and ideas about how to treat my fellow life forms kindly and respectfully. I can usually be found in the abstract.</p>
<p>Some of the things that I am passionate about are protecting our planet, opening the dialog to new perspectives, volunteering and charity, finding elegant answers, learning about cultures new and old, fighting for the freedom and equality of all peoples, transparently spreading knowledge and information, and standing up for principle.</p>
<p>Less sanctimoniously, I enjoy traveling the globe and returning to nature, photographing people and places, reading and writing words, jamming to new music, cuddling up next to my favorite people, and building things that help people in need. I also play a mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalimba" title="Thumb piano">kalimba</a>.</p>
<p>The relentless itch to help people is being scratched at <a href="http://opower.com/" title="Opower">Opower</a>, where my cohorts and I are saving the planet by reducing energy consumption, one household at a time, all around the world, with amazing software. I am but a humble member of our team of brilliant, crazy engineers.</p>
