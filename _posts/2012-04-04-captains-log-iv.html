<p>Welcome to Captain's Log IV, wherein I discuss the status of various projects and other sundry. This month features the Mass Effect Edition, wherein I obliterate my productivity by devoting three weeks to the exploits of Commander Shepard.<!--more--></p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Captain's Log: April 2012</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Side Projects</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/dashing" title="jessex/dashing - Github">dashing</a></strong>&nbsp;- Another month, another 744 hours without touching this project. At one point, I sat down to think about&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;I was so reluctant to work on dashing, and I came to the conclusion that the product I was designing was not something that I would use myself. In recent days though, I have made a slight about-face on this and have started to think that, if a few things were to change and I was able to advance the product to a certain point, I would definitely use it. With that in mind, my goal for April is to simply determine what, if anything, is the future of this project. If it does have a future, a stretch goal would be to begin whatever pivot may be required.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/gistacious" title="jessex/gistacious - Github">gistacious</a></strong>&nbsp;- My goal for gistacious for March was to implement the last layer of the API; I did not. I did&nbsp;<em>begin</em>&nbsp;this effort, and realized that a logical step to come first was to refactor the JSON parsing and serialization logic to use the wonderful&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome" title="JacksonHome">Jackson JSON</a>&nbsp;library. I nearly completed this refactor before running into an issue with figuring out a clean way to serialize JSON for Gist edits, which is formatted differently based on the nature of the edit. So, for April, I intend to finish the Jackson refactor and then complete my goal from March.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/gedit-tables" title="jessex/gedit-tables - Github">Table Maker</a></strong>&nbsp;- Table Maker is now compatible with Gedit 3! This had the nifty side effect of allowing me to upgrade Gedit, which is vastly improved with its new version. In the process of updating the plugin for compatibility, I was also able to clean up its architecture significantly. A few suggestions for improvement have been made, and I'd like to look into implementing them. But I am not going to set a timetable or a hard goal (for this month, at least) to do so.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/CLRS-implementations" title="jessex/CLRS-implementations - Github">CLRS Implementations</a></strong>&nbsp;- I completed my goal for March, which was to complete a few more implementations in Python and Ruby and to begin on Scheme implementations. My goal for April: more Scheme implementations. I look forward to writing down my thoughts on Lisp after a tad more experience, because it has been immensely fun so far!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/Eratosthenes" title="jessex/Eratosthenes - Github">Eratosthenes</a></strong>&nbsp;- This project is a very recent addition to my log: a fork of a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mclarkk/Eratosthenes" title="mclarkk/Eratosthenes - Github">cool tool</a>&nbsp;to visualize the rational numbers over a 2D grid. So far, I have completed a refactor and repackaging of the core code, and have implemented the ability to tweak parameters with command line arguments. For April, I intend to improve the command line argument code (which is pretty deplorable at the moment) and to look into allowing one to save the images that are produced. I have several stretch goals in mind for the project, including architecting the code to allow one to "plug in" different types of numeric formulae to visualize.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that I also conceived of and completed&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/HaltPy" title="jessex/HaltPy - Github">HaltPy</a></strong>, a script to determine if an arbitrary program will eventually terminate. It was pretty trivial to implement so I don't intend to work on it any further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Workish Projects</strong></p>
<p>For Innovation Day, I worked with a couple of super-talented Opower folks to upgrade an internal tool we have that gives quick access to status information about various apps across various tiers for various clients. I will continue to work on improvement and maintenance for it going forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Ventures</strong></p>
<p><strong>W.A.R.E.</strong>&nbsp;- My whiteboard remained clean in March, most unfortunately. Hopefully this month will see some me hammering out some more maths. No concrete goals, though (notice how the "preliminary" label allows me to skirt responsibility for these "ventures").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Photography</strong>&nbsp;- I did not push an album to Flickr, like I had planned to. I did get my Instagram on, though, which was also planned. In approximately one month, however, I leave for Europe and I will have to have a camera by then to properly document the amazement of the Old World. So my photography goal for April is three-fold: a) push that album to Flickr and keep on Instragram'in, b) get that elusive photographing device, and c) experiment with it in anticipation of photographing stuff across the Atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>Writing</strong>&nbsp;- I wrote a post about my thoughts on some practices of software engineering and penned a short introduction for the super awesome&nbsp;<em>HaltPy</em>, but did not accomplish my actual goal, which was to continue with the&nbsp;<em>Stream of Consciousness</em>&nbsp;experiment. Thus, my March goal carries over into April.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: small;">General Comments</strong></p>
<p>March was a tale of two cities (don't be a litigious&nbsp;<em>dickens</em>, Mr. Charles). The first three weeks of March were, as my introduction alluded to, devoted to&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect III</em>. I adore the Mass Effect universe and its mythology, and so I felt compelled--perhaps to a fault--to complete the trilogy. As such, I did almost nothing productive outside of work until late in the month.</p>
<p>Once I did finish the game, however, I had a personal Renaissance of sorts and my productivity burst (twas glorious!). All of the aforementioned progress was completed in the last week-and-a-half of the month, and will, most hopefully, carry over into April. The impending multi-week European excursion in May looms near, providing me the slightest bit of external pressure to accomplish each of my goals for the month. Fingers have been crossed.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, it occurs to me that these posts are labeled for the month that is incoming and not for the month that has just occurred. Though I do discuss both progress for the previous month and goals for the "current" month, it might likely confused some readers. Sadly, the rule in nature is that once you've done something three times you cannot change how you do it. If only...</p>
