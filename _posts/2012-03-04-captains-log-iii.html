<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Captain's Log: March 2012</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Side Projects</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/dashing" title="jessex/dashing - Github">dashing</a></strong>&nbsp;- I did next to nothing concrete with this project during February. I had some informal&nbsp;<em>thinking sessions</em>&nbsp;about the project and how I would like to structure it going forward, but did nothing with the code. There is a bit of an inertia regarding dashing that I cannot quite put my finger on, but I need to figure it out before this project stalls out for good, particularly at such an early stage in its development. My goals for the project remain the same as last month: "work on the infrastructure, add more dashes, quit dodging work on this project."</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/gistacious" title="jessex/gistacious - Github">gistacious</a></strong>&nbsp;- My goal for gistacious for February was to begin to convert the project from an Android application into a basic Java library for the Github Gist API. Though I have not touched this project much in the past two weeks, there was a flurry of activity in the first half of the month and I succeeded in accomplishing my goals. There has been a significant refactor in the architecture of the library and the code is overall of a much higher quality; it is well on its way to a 1.0 release. My goal for March is to complete the last unimplemented section of the library (the layer which parses the response from the API calls) so that it is fully functioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/gedit-tables" title="jessex/gedit-tables - Github">Table Maker</a></strong>&nbsp;- Unfortunately, like dashing, I did not work on Table Maker at all this month. There is really no reason other than I never found myself with the requisite time and desire to work on it. As such, the goal remains the same: refactor the plugin for compatibility with Gedit 3.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/CLRS-implementations" title="jessex/CLRS-implementations - Github">CLRS Implementations</a></strong>&nbsp;- I completed a few more algorithm implementations in both Ruby and Python but have yet to push them to the repository on Github, simply because I have yet to review them for correctness in some edge cases. In March, I will finally push these implementations, implement a few more algorithms in these two languages and begin implementations in one of the planned languages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Workish Projects</strong></p>
<p>Nothing was done with Obot or the Wall of Shame, and likely nothing will be done in the foreseeable future. However, Opower has an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=opower+innovation+day" title="Opower Innovation Day... Google Results because there is no authoritative web page about Innovation Day that I could find to link to">Innovation Day</a> coming up at the end of March and hopefully I will be able to come up with a completely world- and reality-altering project that shocks and awes the greatest minds in Computer Science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Ventures</strong></p>
<p><strong>W.A.R.E.</strong>&nbsp;- At the beginning of February, I stated, "If I can get my white board colorful and my home office smelling of markers in a fury of mathematic scribbling, I will be quite pleased." At the end of February, I could say, "<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRaLpHoZA8E" title="These pretzels are making me thirsty">These pretzels are making me thirsty</a></span>. These marker fumes are making me&nbsp;<em>hazy</em>." I did some more mathematical brainstorming, but there is much more work to be done to get the foundation for this system to a workable state. More whiteboarding is on tap for March!</p>
<p>There are two other projects that I may start on during March: one involving text-to-speech and another involving an OS X client for one of my favorite news sites on the Web. I am excited for both, but I think that the latter is ultimately more likely to begin in March because it involves learning a completely new language and writing for a completely new platform, both of which intrigue me to no end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Photography</strong>&nbsp;- I snapped some more photos and got some more general camera time during February, but nothing was pushed to Flickr or Instagram. And I still have not obtained that mythical and long sought-after camera, though the deadline for said purchase is May. In March, I plan to deliver some actual photographs to both of the two aforementioned photo repositories.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Writing</strong>&nbsp;- My goals for February were to a) write another public&nbsp;<em>Stream of Consciousness</em>&nbsp;post on this blog, and to b) write some private&nbsp;<em>Stream of Consciousness</em>&nbsp;posts in my journal. These goals were both met, and I also found the time to compose a couple of short essays. I would like to repeat this in March, hopefully getting myself close to the point where my&nbsp;<em>stream</em>&nbsp;experiment can be completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: small;">General Comments</strong></p>
<p>February was a bit disappointing from an overall productivity perspective. This can be explained by two primary arguments. First, the beginning of February was dedicated primarily to gistacious, drawing attention away from other initiatives. Second, the end of February involved some issues in my personal life which discouraged me from spending any meaningful amount of time on my non-Opower work. The former reason is ultimately not a real problem, as I see no problem with choosing to buckle down and focus my efforts in one direction for an expanse of time. And furthermore, it is entirely possible that as time goes on over the next few months, I may find that having so many ongoing projects of such varied natures is damaging to my ability to stay productive. Context switching is hard. The latter reason, however,&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a real issue. It distracted me, consuming large swaths of time that otherwise might have gone to my work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is difficult to tell how much my previously stated concern ("that the level of work at my day job lead to a bit of fatigue toward my side projects") played a role in February's decrease in output, because of the more personal concerns which had a direct, clearly identifiable effect. Assuming a return to some measure of "normality" in my personal life, March will be an interesting barometer of how my working&nbsp;<em>fecundity</em>&nbsp;will develop going forward.</p>
