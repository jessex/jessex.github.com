<p>Anna and Mark are alike in a number of ways. They are both nice, friendly, environmentally-conscious people. They both live in cozy urban homes, they are both frugal with their money and they both care about the environment. They both recycle, they both use public transportation to commute to work and they both turn lights off in rooms when they leave. They both know a few tips and tricks to cut down on their energy use and they both do what they can,&nbsp;<em>within their respective budgets</em>, to save energy and live eco-friendly. But Anna has a major advantage. And that's where they diverge.<!--more--></p>
<p>Mark lives in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia which gets its energy from the city-wide utility company,&nbsp;<em>ABC</em>. Recently he received his energy bill for the month of January and he was not pleased. By his recollection, and confirmed after digging through his stack of December bills, he owed only about $70.00 in the previous month; this time he owed about $120.00. He had no surefire way of knowing, but he suspected it was due to the cold Winter weather: heating one's home in a harsh mid-Atlantic January does not come cheap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark paid his bill, and hoped that next month he might be able to use less energy on heating, and that he might be able protect his checking account. He wondered to himself whether his neighbors had experienced similar rises in their energy bills; but he quickly realized that not all of his neighbors have similar sized homes, not all of his neighbors&nbsp;have&nbsp;the same amount of people in their homes and not all of his neighbors necessarily heat their homes in the same way. He would have to find out&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;neighbors had the most similar homes and then compare how their&nbsp;<em>specific&nbsp;</em>energy use stacked up.</p>
<p>"It would be too difficult to figure all of that out. It would take too much time," Mark thought to himself. He was right: he doesn't have that data at his disposal, he doesn't have enough time to sit around crunching those numbers and he doesn't even know the precise ways in which he is using his own energy.</p>
<p>So instead he searched online for helpful hints on how to keep his home warm in the Virginia Winter and, after some searching, did learn a few things. Mark hopes that it will help, but the only way he'll really be able to know for sure is if that "Amount Owed" item on the bottom of next month's energy bill goes down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's doing his best. He wants to use less energy and he wants to save some money, but he doesn't have the tools at his disposal to make the most educated choices.</p>
<p>And that is Anna's advantage.</p>
<p>Anna lives in a single-family home in Minneapolis, Minnesota which gets its energy from the local utility company,&nbsp;<em>XYZ</em>. Like Mark, Anna recently received an energy report and, like Mark, was not extremely pleased with what she saw. But Anna was not displeased because her bill had gone up. No, Anna received a home energy report which told her, to her chagrin, that she had slipped in her Neighbor Rank! Last month, she had the 12th most efficient home in her neighborhood and now she had slipped to 16th.</p>
<p>Being competitive by nature, Anna too was curious. So she looked further into her home energy report and found that, though she had done quite well and was in fact more efficient than her most efficient neighbors on average, her natural gas usage had increased at a rate greater than the previous Winter months and, more to the point, her heating usage was about 23% higher than that of her neighbors. So, as she suspected, heating in the bitter cold Minnesota January had been the culprit. But she wanted to know how exactly her heating usage had increased; after all, she thought that she was being as mindful of her energy usage as possible.</p>
<p>She logged into her home energy web portal through the&nbsp;<em>XYZ</em>&nbsp;website and took a look at the graph of her energy usage. Anna studied the hourly energy usage of her home on January 1st. Then January 2nd, and January 3rd. She checked the hourly usage for several days in a row and noticed a pattern: her energy usage spiked in the first hour spent at home after the work day. And furthermore, that spike was even more pronounced on days which were colder. Anna realized, "My neighbor rank went down because I was cranking my thermostat up to heat up the house after I got home."&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Anna clicked over to the Ideas and Advice section and checked for tips related to heating. She had already committed to a few of the tips which were free, but decided that she was prepared to spend a little bit more to cut down on her energy usage in the Winter and wanted to know what her neighbors were doing. She sorted the tips by popularity and found a few of the most popular ones that piqued her interest, marking down that she planned to follow through. Anna felt empowered to get her neighbor rank back to the top!</p>
<p>But she didn't stop there: she pulled her smart phone from her pocket and clicked on the thermostat app. The app lets her control her home thermostat from her phone, such as telling the thermostat to set itself to distinct temperatures at different points in the day. It recommended that, during the Winter, she set her thermostat to 60<strong style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">&deg;</strong>&nbsp;Fahrenheit when she is away and 68<strong style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">&deg;</strong>&nbsp;Fahrenheit when she is home. Anna accepted the recommendation and told the thermostat to warm up from the away temperature to the home temperature so that, by the time she got home in the evening, it would be both comfortable for her and more energy efficient.</p>
<p>Satisfied that she had prepared herself to use less energy next month, Anna signed into her usage-focused Facebook app to check out how she compared with her friends in the past month. She checked the leader board for her friends' group and saw that, just like in her neighborhood, she had slipped in the ranking; she fell out of the top spot all the way to 6th place! Her college buddy, who lives in Boston, posted a little trash talk to celebrate his rise to number one. Anna smiled and, knowing that she was ready to take back the top spot amongst both her friends&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>her neighbors, traded a barb or two of her own.</p>
<p>Just a little extra incentive to save&nbsp;<em>even&nbsp;more</em>&nbsp;next month!</p>
<p>And she will, because Anna's utility partnered with some smart people who gave them the software they needed to turn the mountain of energy data pouring in every minute of every day into usable knowledge for its customers. Because of her home energy reports, the interactive web site, her smart thermostat with the nifty phone interface, and her social app to compete against her friends, Anna has the tools and knowledge that she needs to be as friendly to the environment, and to her wallet, as she can be.</p>
<p>Mark's utility doesn't have the same partnership; it doesn't have the technology it needs to help empower its customers to be more efficient. Mark wants to save energy, but he doesn't have the advantages that Anna does.</p>
<p>When Anna gets a text message alert sent to her phone to tell her that tomorrow is a peak usage day, she'll be ready to adjust accordingly. She'll save a few kilowatt-hours and even a few dollars. Mark might not be so prepared.</p>
