<p>Throughout my schooling, I have developed a big penchant for productivity. When I see laziness or general malaise, especially in my youthful, energetic peers, I have to wonder what is going on in that person's head. Of course, everyone is wired differently. But it still seems intrinsically inhuman to let one's innate creativity go to waste; to not pursue one's passions is a sad fate, indeed. That's why I find it so unconditionally important to create. I mean, what are you <em>doing</em> if you aren't doing what you love to the fullest extent possible?</p>
<p>My perspective is one of a soon-to-be-graduated Computer Science student whose hobbies and profession happen to intersect and overlap a great deal. Some of my greatest thrills include implementing seemingly crazy new algorithms that I just recently learned about and finding exquisite, clever ways to bound over hurdles in my latest projects. I hope to have a long and happy career doing what I love. I could only wish to be so lucky. But if for some hellishly unfortunate reason I do not, I will continue to build and create software to the fullest extent that I can muster.</p>
<p>Why? Because it is what I am passionate about.<!--more--></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Full Steam Ahead</strong></span></p>
<p>If you feel great joy for something: pursue it to the ends of the Earth (unless what you love is Astronomy then pursue it to the ends of the Universe). Never, ever stop yourself from doing what you love. There are so many facets of daily life that are out of one's control that at least choosing how to spend your precious time seems invaluable. Obviously there may be extenuating circumstances, particularly those which are financial in nature. But it is vital that you make time if you are truly serious about your craft. It is merely a matter of finding a way to keep yourself in the mindset that you will do whatever it takes to produce and create. And yes, everyone can offer their own personalized insights on how to stay productive and on how to exercise your creativity to the fullest. But I will not attempt to do that here. What I will argue is that it is absolutely, positively critical to never relent in exercising your creative abilities.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>Take time to deliberate; but when the time for action arrives, stop thinking and go in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Napoleon Bonaparte meant when he said this, I believe, is that ultimately actions are the end-goals of ideas. Making plans, coming up with new ideas and conceptualizing lay a groundwork. But that's it. They are foundations for a later manifestation of the <em>real</em>. Now, this is not a dichotomy, not a discrete, binary issue. Thought informs action, action informs thought. They are two sides of the same coin. And yet, there is often a clash in practice; in the mind of the potential creator, it is much too easy to get caught on the rails of endless idealism. You have to put these thoughts and ideas into tangible form to spring new life.</p>
<p>When you do create, when you do produce something new, you have made an extension of yourself. Your humanity and being are forever tied to what you have contributed into the human community. To relent on this matter is to sell yourself remarkably short. Hacking away at your latest project, placing your innermost thoughts and feelings onto a blank canvas, building something truly unique with your hands... all examples of placing your stamp on the world around you. That is the ultimate product of your labor.</p>
<p>And the best way to chase such a prize is to work as hard as you can. Create projects that interest you, projects that you think others may be interested in or projects that you think will make a contribution to something, anything. Force yourself to overcome challenges and roadblocks by exhausting every resource possible. Let your wildest and most far out ideas come to the surface and become incarnate. And then do it again. And again. Continue to execute new ideas and if you believe you have run out, find some more.</p>
<p>If it sounds like a lot of work, that's because it is. But if you love something, then the effort required to do the spectacular should come naturally. And besides, there are a million reasons not do something. But they don't always stick quite right.</p>
<p><em>Oh, you don't know if you have the talent to make something worthwhile?</em> Well, "practice makes perfect" has become cliche for a reason. And besides, why let fear of failure derail you before you even begin? The only surefire way to fail is not to try. Effort gives you a chance. And as that effort increases, so does your chance to do something big.</p>
<p><em>Oh, you already did your part? Made your fortune? Already did something amazing?</em> It is a terrible idea to let your past successes (or failures) direct your present and future actions. Settling into complete lethargy does nothing for you, or for anyone else. In any event, what have you done lately? The longer you move on by living solely off of your past accomplishments, the less value these accomplishments have. It fades with time. Don't let your creativity go the same route.</p>
<p><em>Oh, you don't have the time? You have other priorities?</em> Life is a tightrope act and foregoing something as important as your inner creativity is inherently unbalanced. Choosing not to put forth your best effort in your work means that you have chosen something else to spend time and energy on. Fine. But it is hard to believe that there is absolutely no time available for these pursuits... and if there really isn't, maybe that is not a desirable lifestyle.</p>
<p>But you know what is? Working as hard as you can to build, to innovate and to achieve. Higher productivity leads to greater creative output and in turn pride, achievement and personal gain for you, and a contribution for your specific segment of the world. If you ignore excuses and naysayers, you just may be surprised by what you can achieve. All it takes is your best effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Easy Now</strong></span><p />But I assure you that this is not some inane "idle hands" commentary, or an attack on sloth. It's definitely not an attack on rest. The occasional repose is critical to keeping your mind fresh. Working endlessly, tirelessly... hammering away at intractable problems until the blood trickles from your temples: these are things to be done in moderation. The mind begins to lose its edge after so much straining; focusing and creating at a high rate become proportionately more difficult. These are inescapable truths. But I wouldn't <em>want</em> to escape such an axiom.</p>
<p>Spending all of one's time wrapped in the pursuit of maximal productivity hits some marks but misses so many others. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_%28film%29" title="Tron">Kevin Flynn</a> once said while plotting how (not) to escape his own creations:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>It's amazing how productive doing nothing can be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Value through inactivity: it's not just for civil disobedience any more. Taking a respite let's you stop and appreciate beauty, of simplicity, of people, of being passive to the world. Of letting things develop without having a hand in every bit of minutia. Of letting go, if only for a brief moment. And once you have let your mind recalibrate and you find yourself ready to dive back in, you may find that you have acquired a fresh, new perspective.</p>
<p>And that's the trick: perspective is everything. When you overwork and you run yourself through brick walls for too long, your mindset becomes worn down and burrowed into the murk. It becomes remarkably easy to lose sight of bigger pictures and broader goals; you become way too entrenched and engrained in the most singular of pursuits. The other side of the token, of course, is that evading effort and staying aloof for too long pushes your perspective to lofty, hyper-elevated heights. You become detached. You lose sight of these same goals, but from an entirely separate angle. Passivity breeds passivity in a positive feedback loop of aversion and apathy: when you become so removed from your creative side, you find that it grows that much more arduous to find your way back because you've become <em>comfortable</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The Point</span></strong></p>
<p>Just as it can be tempting to destroy yourself trying to push forward on that next big project, it can be equally tempting to wave your hand and proclaim that you'll <em>get to it later</em>. Creation stagnates. And really, that's the entire point of this discourse.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather  than ability. your tastes only narrow &amp; exclude people. so create.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That, of course, is one of the most widely quoted truisms from <a href="http://viewsourcecode.org/why/" title="_why's Estate"><em>why the lucky stiff</em></a>, and it is my personal favorite. Everyone has passions, everyone finds little intricacies of this vast world to be captivated by. Why let these go by without taking part, without playing an active role in shaping their futures?</p>
<p>Sampling and consuming and partaking are great, for sure. But what will you say when you look back on these fascinations later in life? That you experienced a great deal? Or will you be able to say that you tried your best to create experiences for others? If the former is what interests you: fine. But I simply cannot see how the latter would not be enticing on some level. Because this is a world of reciprocities, of interactions. Because contributing works and ideas makes a real impact on society and on the world. But also because it makes an impact on the creator. The act of creation imprints upon you the knowledge that you have been a force for good, that you have positively changed the reality in which you reside.</p>
<p>And a fact of this reality is that we are all sewn into the fabric of our environment. Stitching in more threads makes the fabric that much stronger.</p>
<p>So go forth and Create. Develop. Build. Design. Write. Interact. Think. Discover. Learn. Innovate. Inspire. And every now and then, take the time to enjoy the world that you are helping to construct. <strong>You've earned it</strong>.</p>
