<p>In six days, I leave to spend just over two weeks in Europe. I am not being hyperbolic when I say that I anticipate that the experience will be life-altering. Not only will it be my first time traveling off of the US East Coast, and not only will it be my first time on an airplane, but it will be my first time being fully immersed in a culture which is not American. To say that this is an important experience for me is a significant understatement; all of my pontification about the virtues of openness in culture and society is mostly platitudinous without experience in cultures which are wholly foreign to me. I view it as life-altering because it has the potential to either drastically change my worldview or to largely validate it. I am optimistic that it will lean toward the latter.</p>
<p>Over some fifteen days, I will bounce around England, France, Italy and Spain. There will be much sight-seeing, much street-wandering and way too much awed gazing and photographing. I decided pretty early on that I wanted this experience to be free-form: on a macro scale, I am maintaining only a very loose itinerary, and on a micro scale, I am making no housing or continental travel arrangements beforehand. I will have a general idea of where I am going and what I would like to do, but most decision-making will be done&nbsp;<em>just in time</em>. In order to effectively pursue this, I must pack light.&nbsp;<em>Very light</em>.&nbsp;<!--more--></p>
<p>With advice from my favorite super awesome travel companion (<span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>I'll see you in Paris</em></span>) and&nbsp;<a href="http://zenhabits.net/kids-ultralight/" title="Teaching Kids to Pack Ultralight">helpful tips</a>&nbsp;from a genius in, well,&nbsp;<em>life</em>, I set out to pack mostly the bare essentials, with a few leisure items, fitting in only one bag. Ideally, it would be light enough that I am largely unaware of its presence during my travels and spacious enough to carry everything that I need (and anything I acquire along the way). After some planning, I ended up with this:</p>
<p><div id="image-container"><img src="/images/packinglight.jpeg" alt="Packing light" title="Packing light"/></div></p>
<p>The inventory is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pair of jeans</li>
<li>A pair of shorts</li>
<li>Three T-shirts</li>
<li>A long sleeved shirt</li>
<li>Four pairs of underwear</li>
<li>Four pairs of socks</li>
<li>A set of awesome shades</li>
<li>A pair of running shoes</li>
<li>A pair of flip flops</li>
<li>A water bottle</li>
<li>A toothbrush</li>
<li>Travel-sized toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo and conditioner</li>
<li>Claritin and Blistex</li>
<li>A journal (with pencil)</li>
<li>A book (technically two in one hard copy:&nbsp;<em>Walden</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Civil Disobedience</em>, both by Thoreau)</li>
<li>A smartphone (with charger)</li>
<li>A set of headphones</li>
<li>A set of plug adapters</li>
<li>A wallet and a passport</li>
<li>A camera (with charger) (seen below)</li>
<li>A bag to put it all in (and it fits splendidly!)</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>How well this arrangement works in my travels will not be determined until I am strolling the avenues of Paris and wandering the alleys of Barcelona, but I am wonderfully excited. At times, I feel claustrophobic when I take stock of all of my material possessions and my big, comfortable apartment, as though all of these items have formed a wall around me, preventing any escape from a most peculiar insulation: borders of pure excess. At various points in recent years, I have cleaned house, so to speak, and given away a good portion of my goods to charity. But somehow they always come back; likely, the excess is a symptom of something deeper, not a condition in its own right. Regardless, packing light in this manner should be a learning experience.</p>
<p>(And it is little secret that I have always romanticized the nomadic lifestyle. From the vagabonds of centuries past to <a href="http://www.vagabondjourney.com/travelogue/hitchhiking-around-the-world/" title="Hitchhiking Around the World">modern day full-time travelers</a>, the stories and adventures of these worldly heroes delight me to no end. If I may be so lucky, I would be delighted to come across some of these amazing people in the hostels and streets of the Old World.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, packing light is not just about practicality and ease, it is about shedding that which serves only to distract. It can allow one to focus on the people and the places, instead of the luggage and the logistics. One less item to worry about means one more opportunity to explore a new little parcel of the world.</p>
