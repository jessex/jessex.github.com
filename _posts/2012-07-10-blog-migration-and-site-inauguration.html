<p><strong>tl;dr: My blog has been migrated from Posterous to my new site at <em><a title="Joshua Essex is a Person" href="http://jessex.ch/">jessex.ch</a></em>!</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The revolution will be televised</span> The migration will be blogged about! After finally willing myself to put in the work, I have migrated my blog from&nbsp;<a title="Some Ruminations" href="http://essexj.posterous.com/">Posterous</a>&nbsp;to my personal site, <em><a title="Joshua Essex is a Person" href="http://jessex.ch/">jessex.ch</a></em>. On the new site, one can expect to find a short auto-biographical summary on the front page, a catalog of my various projects, an action-packed blog and a <a title="Four, Oh Four" href="http://jessex.ch/404">dynamically feline-allocated 404 page</a>. All future blog posts will be published directly on the new site. Thusly, this is my last (foreseen) post on the Posterous blog and the first post published directly on the new site.</p>
<p>Part of the desire to change formats was the Twitter acquisition of Posterous. It signaled that Posterous would eventually wind down support and shut its doors. I think it is better to be proactive now before I am left using whatever tools they provide at the last minute to migrate my data, if any. More critically, however, I simply wished to take control of my little piece of Internet real estate. The feeling of pushing posts to a hand-crafted site instead of a pre-packaged blogging platform, as nicely designed and implemented as it may be, is a warm and fuzzy one.</p>
<p>The new site is built using Tom Preston-Werner's <a title="Jekyll" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a>. It was easy to install and configure and get to building, nearly frictionless in the process. I find that Jekyll mostly stays out of your way, letting you spin up whatever you want while silently providing a minimal, light-weight framework to build off of. The <a title="Liquid for Designers" href="https://github.com/shopify/liquid/wiki/liquid-for-designers">Liquid</a> template system is dynamic enough to let you get relatively fancy, but simple enough that a novice could get something built in a couple of hours. Configuration is a snap with YAML, particularly of post metadata via YAML front matter blocks on each post. And there's a post format for everyone, as long as everyone likes HTML, Markdown or Textile.</p>
<p>And to top it all off, the <a title="Jekyll Wiki" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/">documentation</a> is excellent.</p>
<p>To build the site, I used a modified <a title="Posterous migrator" href="https://github.com/pepijndevos/jekyll/blob/patch-1/lib/jekyll/migrators/posterous.rb">Posterous migration script</a>&nbsp;to grab all of my posts off of the old blog while maintaining smart permalinks and formatting. I used some basic grep'ing and regex'ing to modify permalinks, categories, tags and other metadata to my liking and then did some light, manual massaging of each post for polish. I then took control of the&nbsp;template&nbsp;engine and built on the design of the repository archive page, which used to be the only page on the site, to add in my blog archive. I laid out templates for the individual posts, the blog archive, the code archive and common elements thereof, and stylized the whole thing with some basic CSS. The actual process of building the site to its current state was only a couple of hours of work; time spent doing stylization was at least double of that as I repeatedly iterated on the design and worked out kinks which arose.</p>
<p>The domain name is registered through Switzerland's <a title="SWITCH" href="http://www.switch.ch/">SWITCH</a>, who primarily targets Swiss universities but is available to any one. The DNS is hosted by Namecheap's <a title="Namecheap FreeDNS" href="http://www.namecheap.com/products/freedns.aspx">FreeDNS</a> service. And the actual site is hosted at Github using their <a title="Github Pages" href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> service, which actually uses Jekyll on the back end to generate the sites. Being hosted by Github, <em>jessex.github.com</em> resolves to <em>jessex.ch</em>. I considered many hosting options before choosing Github, whom I went with largely for convenience's sake. Free, reliable, easy. That's precisely what I want in a basic, static, personal site.</p>
<p>There is still work to be done, however. I would like to add the ability to comment directly on blog posts, preferably with a system that takes the heavy lifting out of my hands such as <a title="Disqus" href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. I would also like to add the ability to subscribe to blog updates, maybe utilizing something as simple as RSS. Code snippets and syntax highlighting are something to be explored, as well: at present, all snippets are hosted as&nbsp;<a title="Gist" href="https://gist.github.com/">Github Gists</a> and embedded on the page via &lt;script&gt; tags. However, Jekyll provides syntax highlighting support via <a title="Pygments" href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a>;&nbsp;doing code blocks directly within the post would cut out one more external dependency and give me more direct control over formatting.</p>
<p>And of course, the design, layout and structure are subject to change on a moment's notice.</p>
<p>But overall, I am quite pleased with how it has turned out thus far. I'm still pretty new to web development, particularly on the front end, and the tools provided by Jekyll helped to make my labors as easy as possible. Hopefully you will like the new site as much as I do! If you want to check out the source, it, like the site itself, is hosted on <a title="jessex/jessex.github.com" href="https://github.com/jessex/jessex.github.com">Github</a>. Feel free to fork and improve!</p>
