<p>This is the second in an ongoing series of entries I am calling the Captain's Log: monthly posts detailing my progress on various projects and efforts.<!--more--></p>

<p><strong style="font-size: medium;">Captain's Log: February 2012</strong></p>
<p><strong>Side Projects</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/dashing" title="jessex/dashing - Github">dashing</a></strong>&nbsp;- "So I am moving forward with two main initiatives in mind: expand the feature set but also continue to build out the main infrastructure on both the front and back ends. One of these may have to yield to the other if I do not get to devote enough time to this." That's what I said about one month ago. As it turns out, I probably did have enough time to work on it but I ended up distributing time elsewhere; subsequently, this project suffered. The only progress I made with it in the past month was to add the ability to configure background color on a per-dash basis, as opposed to enforcing a single color for the entire board. That's it. So my mission remains the same: work on the infrastructure, add more dashes, quit dodging work on this project.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/gistacious" title="jessex/gistacious - Github">gistacious</a></strong>&nbsp;- My goal for gistacious for January was to determine in which direction to take it: keep it as an Android project and invest in the necessary hardware to enable adequate development and testing, or convert it into another form, such as a library wrapper for the Gist API. That goal was accomplished: Gistacious is becoming a Java wrapper for the Github Gist API, with a design goal focused around being lightweight and intuitive. I spent a few separate blocks of time thinking and walking through the design of the library, and am confident that this will be a stronger project: decoupling the API handling from the mobile app allows me to focus on a more manageable chunk of work and to develop something that I have the capability to work with (ie. no special hardware required). Plus it is just overall better design. This month, I plan to begin re-factoring and to convert the project structure away from an Android application to a standard Java library. Hopefully some one will be able to use the library to develop the app that I had originally set out to construct!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/gedit-tables" title="jessex/gedit-tables - Github">Table Maker</a></strong>&nbsp;- This was a project that I had worked on and completed (to the ongoing maintenance stage of the lifecycle, at least) several months ago. It is essentially an ASCII table maker plug-in for the Gedit text editor. You can quickly throw together neatly formatted tables with your choice of ASCII characters, structure options and even data options. However, an&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jessex/gedit-tables/issues/1" title="Does this work with Gedit 3?">issue</a>&nbsp;was brought up: it does not work with Gedit 3. I looked into it and found that, somewhat disappointingly, the update from Gedit 2 to Gedit 3 broke compatibility with Gedit 2.x Python plugins. So my goal for this month is to re-factor the plugin to make it compatible with Gedit 3.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/CLRS-implementations" title="jessex/CLRS-implementations - Github">CLRS Implementations</a></strong>&nbsp;- This is a new project that started up in January: to implement the medley of algorithms found in&nbsp;<em>Introduction to Algorithms</em>&nbsp;(colloquially referred to as&nbsp;<em>CLRS</em>) in a variety of languages. Thus far, I have implemented a handful of algorithms in Ruby and in Python, but have plans for implementations in Scheme, Haskell and Scala. My two February goals for this project are to continue implementing in Ruby and Python and to begin writing some implementations in one of the planned languages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Workish Projects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obot</strong>&nbsp;- I had another request from a colleague to bring our&nbsp;<em>Hubot</em>&nbsp;implementation internal so that fellow Opeople can hack on it, but did not get the opportunity to do so. I did however create a&nbsp;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/flipping-tables-%E2%95%AF%E2%96%A1%EF%BC%89%E2%95%AF%EF%B8%B5-%E2%94%BB%E2%94%81%E2%94%BB" title="GOD DAMNIT">table flipping</a>&nbsp;script for the bot, which has so far been extremely amusing. I sincerely hope to bring it into Opower soon.</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Shame</strong>&nbsp;- This month was a tale of two news'es (I am perfectly aware how awful that word is, thank you): good and bad. Bad: I put forth no effort on this project whatsoever. I was simply too busy with my, you know,&nbsp;<em>actual work</em>, that it just did not happen. Good: Mr. Miller will indeed prettify it for me, whenever we can get around to it. I am not optimistic that I will do much with it this month, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Ventures</strong></p>
<p><strong>W.A.R.E.</strong>&nbsp;- I had the insight at one random point this month (I think it was a Wednesday), that a project that my team at Opower had worked on recently was, essentially, a recommendation engine. It might not have had as much raw material to chew through as the entire Wikipedia archives, but it was theoretically somewhat similar. This got me to thinking about the mathematics behind this again, which is good. I am going to set one goal for W.A.R.E. for this month: begin formulating an algorithm for this recommendation. If I can get my white board colorful and my home office smelling of markers in a fury of mathematic scribbling, I will be quite pleased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Photography</strong>&nbsp;- There were two photography goals for January: to keep on&nbsp;<em>Instagram'ing</em>&nbsp;and "to get closer to purchasing a camera". The hilarity of that absurdly vague latter goal, aside, I can assert that I accomplished these goals. I got&nbsp;<a href="http://web.stagram.com/n/meta_physic" title="meta_physic">a few more Instagrams</a>&nbsp;under my belt and I did decide which DSLR I do intend to procure (d'alliteration!). Additionally, I got to shoot some photographs with an awesome person's camera up on Flickr, and I feel like I am starting to get a feel for what it is that I like to capture with a lens (I would not dare call it a photographic style, yet, because that would insult every photographer ever). So February's primary goal is to keep shooting and keep imagining. I will purchase that camera, eventually, with a hard constraint of early May, when I will absolutely need it to document my European exploits.</p>
<p><strong>Writing</strong>&nbsp;- Though I did get to write an essay and a short story that had popped up in my head, my stated writing goals for this month were to continue my Stream of Consciousness self-experiment: in the form of an additional&nbsp;<em>stream</em>&nbsp;post here on Posterous and some accompanying posts in my journal. Neither happened. It will happen in February, though. And, more importantly in my opinion, I will keep writing whatever ideas and thoughts may begin to ricochet through my neurons, as I see fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>General Comments</strong></span></p>
<p>January would look a bit jagged if I created a graph depicting the total amounts of progress per project for the month. The projects which were more oriented toward planning and designing, such as figuring out my direction with&nbsp;<em>gistacious</em>, went quite smoothly. Those which involved following through on actual&nbsp;<em>work</em>&nbsp;goals that I set for myself, such as&nbsp;<em>dashing</em>, sort of fell by the wayside. My predicted post-holiday malaise did have an effect as my productivity was lower in the first half of the month than the second, in my estimate. However, I also believe that the level of work at my day job lead to a bit of fatigue toward my side projects; this is something that I must continue to struggle against, lest I become a zombie whose productivity exists only between ten and six.&nbsp;</p>
