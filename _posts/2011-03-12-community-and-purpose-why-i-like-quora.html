<p>For the past week or so, I have been checking out <a href="http://www.quora.com/" title="Quora">Quora</a>.  I had been aware of Quora for at least a couple of months, at least as  far back as when steam began to pick up near the end of 2010. And during  this time, I kept telling myself, "Yeah I'll definitely sign up soon  and give it a look." And due to some combination of malaise and unknown  forces, it just never came to fruition until recently. The question was:  why have I not yet signed up for Quora? I saw it everywhere: Hacker  News, Techcrunch, Mashable, in tweets, in blog postings, everywhere.  Maybe I was feeling inertia because I tend to shy away from things which  build seemingly exponential curves of hype, for some reason. I guess I  was ultimately concerned that I would try it out and would be horribly  disappointed by some as of yet unknown flaw, further rationalizing the  aforementioned shyness.</p>
<p>Haha, whoops!</p>
<p>After playing with Quora for a mere week, my only remaining question is: why do I enjoy it so much?</p>
<p>Quora is a Q&amp;A smorgasbord which seeks to become the go-to site  for anything and everything that may need an answer: "the best possible  resource for someone who wants to know about the question" (from their <a href="http://www.quora.com/about" title="Quora: About">About</a> page). As is a rising trend nowadays, Quora is powered by crowd  intelligence and knowledge: users ask questions which other users then  answer and/or comment on. Questions are organized into different topics,  which can also be created by users. Because of this, topics are  extremely broad spectrum and you can find questions on everything from <a href="http://www.quora.com/Regression-statistics/What-is-Least-Angle-Regression-and-when-should-it-be-used" title="What is Least Angle Regression and when should it be used?">Least Angle Regression</a> to <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-favorite-quotes-from-The-Office" title="What are some favorite quotes from The Office?">quotes from The Office</a> to the <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-communism-and-socialism" title="What are the differences between Communism and Socialism?">differences between Communism and Socialism</a>.</p>
<p>But this is an elevator pitch similar to that which you would hear for a plethora of other sites. So what is that <em>it-factor </em>for me?<em> </em>Could  it be the feature set? The multitude of contributions that can be made?  Well, content is organized into topics and subtopics, which are  creatable and editable by users. Questions in turn are grouped into  topics, with a single question having one to many topic classifications.  Questions are asked by users and can be edited by other users, be it  for wording or for topic organization. Users can answer questions or  comment on the questions themselves: two distinct actions with their own  purposes and contributions. Answers can of course be edited or deleted  by the original author.</p>
<p>Feedback to answers is particularly multifaceted. Of course, there is  the standard upvote/downvote. If you feel an answer is appropriate and  particularly high quality: upvote. If it is very low quality or  superficial: downvote. But what if the answer is not poor in quality?  Maybe it is just a bit inappropriate or incorrect in some manner but you  don't think it warrants something as harsh and foreboding as a  downvote? Mark it as "Not Helpful." And one can do the inverse: "Thank"  the user for their answer. Additionally, you can leave a comment on an  answer and even suggest an edit to be made.</p>
<p>It all makes for a diverse experience, for sure. But other collective  knowledge and Q&amp;A sites offer similarly rich feature sets and I do  not harbor little titillating, giggly feelings for many of them (see: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/" title="Oh my why is this here">Yahoo Answers</a>).  Is it simply the concept of contributing to a knowledge base which  intrigues me? While that definitely is an intriguing concept for a  philosopher such as myself (philosopher in this case meaning "lover of  knowledge" from the Greek <span class="foreign"><em>philosophia</em>),  that does not explain the amorosity for Quora: I adore Wikipedia but I  hardly ever contribute, even though there is both opportunity and  motive. </span></p>
<p><span class="foreign">Yesterday, I read a blog posting by Reg Braithwaite about <a href="https://raganwald.posterous.com/hasta-la-vista-quora" title="Hasta la Vista, Quora!">why he was leaving Quora</a>. The summary of his reasoning is that while Quora has a community, it is not a community <em>in and of itself</em>. As he puts it:</span></p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>You have to buy into the larger, nobler goal of building a repository  of  answers to questions first, and then the community comes as a  bonus,  second. Whereas a place like Hacker News feels like it's a  community  first, and any accumulation of knowledge that might accrete  is secondary  to the community feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That second sentence is precisely why I do enjoy HN: the sense of  community and camaraderie that springs up in the interactions between  users. But I read and re-read that first sentence a handful of times and  it struck me: that's <em>exactly</em> why I enjoy Quora! Quora is not  about community for community's sake; rather, Quora's community is  structured for and aimed toward a very clear, benevolent goal. Maybe it  is that dash of Socialist that resides somewhere inside of me, but the  idea of a <strong>community</strong> which has come together for a <strong>purpose</strong> is something which I find exciting. The purpose is <em>above</em> the community and individual users are contributors to something big and beautiful.</p>
<p>Surely, many Quora users are not there for a higher goal. Perhaps  many of them are there for the reasons that Braithwaite outlined as for  why he was not. Perhaps, they want to make friends and interact with  other people, and Quora just happens to provide a setting which allows  them to do so. But the communal structure is set up to build the  ultimate knowledge base, first and foremost. Anything else comes second.</p>
<p>The public profiles, the ability to personalize biographical text to  individual topics, the Wiki-style logging and revision history, the  changeability of all public space, the commenting and feedback systems:  these are all aimed, at least in part, toward compelling community  members to increase the overall quality of the content that they and  others are contributing to Quora.</p>
<p>The ability to follow topics, questions and people, the  recommendation system, the activity and notification feeds, the  distinctions between <em>Open</em>, <em>Best</em> and <em>Unorganized Questions</em>:  these are all designed to help draw you to the information and content  that you are most likely to interact with and contribute to.</p>
<p>Quora has pretty brilliantly structured itself so that users will  keep coming back. Contributing, organizing, improving. Asking and  answering. Giving and receiving feedback. Creating and editing.</p>
<p>Braithwaite (Raganwald) decided to leave Quora because he wanted to focus on <em>communities</em>,  as in community-first communities. This is perfectly reasonable: hell, I  contribute to Hacker News for precisely those same reasons. That's why  it is by far my most visited website. But the pendulum is swinging:  Quora has established the kind of place that I really want to be a part  of. I've spent far too much time there recently, and it does not seem  likely to recede anytime soon.</p>
<p>A community with a virtuous purpose: what a novel idea.</p>
