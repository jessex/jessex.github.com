<p>This is the inaugural entry into an approximately monthly series of posts aimed at logging and monitoring the general status of various side projects and goings-on (as a side note: I enjoy words structured like that, where the pluralization must come before the end of the word. I find it fanciful). I chose to dub it the "Captain's Log" because a) I like Captain Crunch, b) I used to play with Lincoln Logs and c) I am unoriginal. I never even watched Star Trek.</p>
<p>In this initial log entry, I will focus more on where I hope to go in the next month and less on where I have been previously, to provide a starting point of sorts for the progression of the log. The structure will essentially be to provide a listing of the different projects that I am actively pursuing, each accompanied with a brief description of the progress made in the past month, what I hope to do in the next month and any conclusions, evaluations or other notes which I feel are appropriate. There will also be general comments in the name of overall reflection on my activity and productivity as a whole for the month.<!--more--></p>
<p>To answer a question which may strike the curious reader, I chose to publish this in a "public" setting as an extra motivational factor: the knowledge of its presence in the wild will provide me with a slight boost in incentive to make my best efforts toward accomplishing my goals. I call it the Github Effect: when I first opened up a Github account and began pushing code, it caused a significant upswing in my productivity due to the fact that my code was now visible to people other than just myself. It's about reputation and honor, on some level.</p>
<p>So, without further ado...</p>

<p><strong>Side Projects</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/dashing" title="jessex/dashing - Github">dashing</a></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is a Sinatra/Ruby app that allows a user to design and extend upon a personal dashboard, with a mixture of static and dynamic content. This month, I hope to begin to expand the different dashes that are available, as well as further refining the standard look and feel. At the moment, it is all still very rough and in an exceedingly early state. So I am moving forward with two main initiatives in mind: expand the feature set but also continue to build out the main infrastructure on both the front and back ends. One of these may have to yield to the other if I do not get to devote enough time to this.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/gistacious" title="jessex/gistacious - Github">gistacious</a></strong> - This <em>was</em> a <a href="https://gist.github.com/" title="Gist">Github Gist</a> client that I was building as an Android app. I use the past tense in a not-quite-but-almost literal sense: now that I have switched away from using Android as my mobile OS of choice, and do not wish to sink significant resources into this project so that I can actually build/test/iterate, I have begun to think that this project might be dead in its current form. I have written much (nearly all?) of the back end that is related to actually making calls to the Github Gist API, though it is largely untested. It is possible that with some refactoring, a great deal of testing and some elbow grease that I could simply repurpose the project into a Java wrapper for the API. My goal for the next month is to essentially decide in which direction this project is headed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Workish Projects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obot</strong> - I utilized Github's wonderful open source <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot" title="github/hubot - Github">Hubot</a>, a "life embetterment" Campfire bot, to bring a flexible, stable bot into the engineering chat rooms of Opower. Named Obot, it has been used primarily to mustachify people, places and things to hilarious, and at times offensive, effect. However, it has also been productive in a few ways, so that's nice, too. What I would like to do in the coming month(s) is to bring Obot into the Opower internals, as it is currently only residing on my local machine and my personal Github account (with the changes that I have made since the fork), and is hosted on my personal Heroku account. I would ultimately like to get the code base pushed to the Opower Github account so that fellow Opeeps could hack away on it and build their own Obot functionality. I would also like to get it hosted on Opower hardware so that anyone could troubleshoot it in the event of downtime or some other issue. Though there are active requests at the office to do this, I am doubtful that I will make much headway on it this month.</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Shame</strong> - Without getting into too many specifics, I built a <em>Wall of Shame</em> for Opower's December 2011 edition of Innovation Day. It is, much like <em>dashing</em>, a Sinatra/Ruby app and allows the recording and payment of <strong>X</strong> debt. It is presently hosted on the Opower Github account, but is not actually deployed as a live app anywhere inside of Opower. I am still looking into what precisely needs to be done to get this up and running, as well as gauging what level of interest there would be in using it (considering it is a revival of an older concept that was ostensibly quite popular, I am feeling positive on this matter). My goal for this month is simply to get a more transparent view of the future of this project, and to subsequently rope the incomparable <a href="http://heyitsgarrett.com/" title="Garrett Miller">Garrett Miller</a> into <em>prettifying</em> it for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Ventures</strong></p>
<p><strong>W.A.R.E.</strong> - Stands for Wikipedia Article Recommendation Engine. This idea was actually the topic of this blog's <a href="/blog/an-idea-for-a-thing.html" title="An Idea for a Thing">very first post</a>. You can read all about it there, but the elevator pitch is that this engine, when incorporated into a form factor such as a browser plug-in or extension, would be used to determine which Wikipedia articles an Internet denizen is likely to find interesting and to help lead them to new Wikipedia content that they might not necessarily find otherwise. I have no intention of starting on this in the immediate future, though I do think about it occasionally and have spent a non-trivial amount of time at some point in the past working out what sort of math and technology is involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Photography</strong>&nbsp;- A <a href="/blog/resolutions.html" title="Resolutions">New Year's resolution</a> of mine, I am currently in the process of studying and beginning to practice photography, as a hobby. This is ongoing basically every moment of every day as I am always on the look out for something that I wish to photograph, and I am trying to view and frame much of what I see as though through the lens. My goal for this month is to continue to push my photographic experiments to Instagram, and to get closer to purchasing a camera of my own.</p>
<p><strong>Writing</strong>&nbsp;- Following a sudden drop in overall writing productivity in the first handful of months after beginning at Opower (only four posts on this blog and little to no personal writing throughout the Summer), I have recently seen a resurgence in my motivation to write and the output thereof. My primary writing goals for this month are to compose at least one more public&nbsp;<em>Stream of Consciousness</em> post here, and to create a few corresponding writings in my private journal (as part of an ongoing experiment I am conducting on myself; stay tuned).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>General Comments</strong></p>
<p>After evaluating my goals for each of the various projects for the upcoming month, a trend that I am detecting is that a healthy portion of the work that I have planned is just that: planning. Figuring out what to do with specific projects, or how to move a project to where I would like it to be, or if a project should even continue to exist. I believe that, similar to my thoughts on how my writing productivity dropped in the immediate beginning of my work at Opower, my overall propensity to continue scheming up new side projects and my motivation to follow through waned a tad due to an immense focus on getting up to speed and ready to contribute at work. This provided enough time for uncertainty and lost familiarity to seep in. However, I also have simply had some projects which were born quite recently, and in a relative hurry, which require some additional thought.</p>
<p>For this reason, combined with the need to re-acclimate to my normal work flow following the holiday break, I think that the upcoming month will not be highly productive. If I can meet all of my goals for planning and generally "figuring out" the different projects, then the following months will become increasingly productive as some non-trivial roadblocks will have been eliminated. For now though, there is much rumination to be done.</p>
