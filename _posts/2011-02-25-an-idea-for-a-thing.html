<p>So I spent a good portion of my late-morning and early-afternoon in a Wikipedia-induced coma. As is the case with millions of other people [I'm sure/I hope], I was stuck in an entranced state of Wiki-surfing. The thing that has fascinated me about Wikipedia for a few years now is the multitude of amazing effects caused by the intra-article linking that pervades its graph-like structure. Each article links to several, or dozens or hundreds of other articles and is linked to in kind. And the most readily experienced effect of this is the fact that when you <em>go</em> to Wikipedia, you <em>stay</em> at Wikipedia: articles forward you along to other articles, tickling your intellectual curiosities until you snap out of it at three in the morning and realize you just spent six hours reading everything you will ever want or need to know about both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Renaissance_literature" title="this really happened...">16th century French literature</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree" title="...simultaneously with this">minimum spanning trees</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>As an organization which bills itself as having the ambitious goal of providing free access to the sum of all human knowledge, Wikipedia must certainly be proud of a system which compels readers to find new information and discover links between concepts that they did not previously conceive of. One of the main problems of this, however, is that it is somewhat undirected and disorganized. Of course, this messiness can be fun and it certainly leads to new findings that would not been possible in a more rigid system. But it would be helpful if there were a tool to guide and point you toward Wikipedia articles which are related to ones which you have read previously but had not yet found. Something like... a <strong>Wikipedia article recommendation engine</strong>.</p>
<p>What features would such a system require to actually be helpful? Well, let's see...
<ul>
<li>Keeps track of Wikipedia articles you have surfed</li>
<li>Analyzes your Wiki-history to find articles with similar content; or, articles which are otherwise intriguing to you in some manner</li>
<li>Provides recommendations for interesting articles in an unobtrusive yet easily accessed manner</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The actual recommendation engine is obviously the meat of this sandwich. <strong>Subject matter</strong> is perhaps the most important parameter here: recommending an article on parser generators because you read about the 1919 Black Sox Scandal is a fascinating conclusion but ultimately stupid. But, you are likely to reach a number of content-related articles just by blindly surfing Wikipedia articles as per usual. The goal, remember, is to find not only those articles related to ones you have already read but also articles which you might not find otherwise. So, it may be beneficial to include some sort of parameter for <strong>"closeness"</strong> between the articles, as in the number of edges connecting one article to another on the Wiki-graph. Perhaps, articles which have a high rating for content similarity but are relatively far away should be more highly recommended: after all, it is <em>intriguing</em>.</p>
<p>Other potentially useful parameters could include <strong>tangential relatability</strong> (<em>ie. you read article X. Article Y is related to both X and article Z, yet Z is not related to X; but we recommend Z tangentially</em>), <strong>volume</strong> of article hits (<em>ie. you viewed article X a total of twelve times and article Y a total of seven times, so an article related to X is more valuable than an otherwise equivalent article which is related to Y</em>), <strong>chronology</strong> of article hits (<em>ie. articles related to those viewed more recently are inherently more recommendable than those related to articles viewed earlier</em>) and conceivably many, many more. There are benefits and pitfalls to each of these, of course. With tangential relatability, the syllogistic effect will lead to potentially related articles you may not have otherwise found without first checking that recommended article Y, yet you have to determine how tangential you can be without worsening the results of the recommendation or slipping into an infinite series that destroys your browser (this is not likely to happen).</p>
<p>A potentially awesome feature of this would be to make it distributed (remember: crowd-sourcing is always an option): allow users to provide feedback as to whether a recommended article was actually interesting or useful and integrate feedback results into the algorithm in real-time. You could use this to tweak the coefficients and ratios involved with other parameters, to find articles which are difficult to recommend for, to find articles which are poor recommendations (such as those that show up a high amount of times but generate overwhelmingly poor feedback), etc. Doing this would allow for results which improve over time, transforming our humble recommendation engine into a sort of evolving system which grows and transforms via supervised learning. Stellar.</p>
<p>I think that the best way to package such a utility would be as a browser plug-in. Have the algorithm run, in part or in full, in the background when a Wikipedia article is accessed and have a discrete button which opens a context menu with options to toggle the plug-in on and off, toggle the utilization of feedback on and off, allow the user to flag a recommendation as positive or negative, clear the Wiki-history and the recommendations list and of course pull up the actual list of recommendations for perusing. The plug-in allows easy access to user Wikipedia behaviors and easy access to the recommendations list. Plus, placing it in the browser means it's almost always at the forefront of the user's attention. After all, its entire purpose is to maximize what you get out of the free <em>online </em>encyclopedia.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia API would help out with a great deal of the complexity  involved here, such as that with analyzing and finding new articles. No  crazy, distributed web crawler should be necessary. And as far as I can tell from my admittedly cursory glance over Google, this sort of thing has not been done before. The only somewhat related item I could find was a <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5672443" title="Wikipedia Recommender System">study</a> by C.D. Jensen of the Technical University of Denmark which outlined a system wherein user feedback of articles would help to determine overall article credibility. But it does nothing in the way of actually recommending new articles.</p>
<p>I think that this is an exciting idea with real value for users of Wikipedia, which includes almost everyone who has ever existed ever.</p>
<p>And since the utility stays out of the way until you actually want to use it, it does not impede upon your Wikipedia binging, which I am now going to dive right back into.</p>
