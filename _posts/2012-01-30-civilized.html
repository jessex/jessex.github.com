<p><strong>M-3 and F-6 debate in M-3's quarters on the 1235<sup>th</sup> floor of the south-by-southeast tower of the Metropolitan Residential Zone, dome 37.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">F-6: And just why not? Why not join the Unification Corps?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: <em>Why join</em>? What good could it possibly do to sit around with a group of like-minded people, agreeing with each other about how great some supposedly benevolent dictator is that we have never even met?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">F-6: <em>ETAOIN</em> loves us! He is helping us to forge a <em>better future</em>. If you joined the corps and came to a Circularum, you would understand!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Sitting around in a large circle with everyone from my dome, chanting mantra about how<em> ETAOIN </em>comprises all points on the circle of civilization, that all paths lead to <em>ETAOIN</em>, sounds not only <em>boring</em> but destructive to my personal sensibilities. You shouldn't go either!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">F-6: I just do not see what is so wrong with unity and love and progress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Nothing at all; please stop twisting my words. The <em>problem</em> is that every one is essentially a robot at this point! No one seems to exercise their freedom of will, to live independently. Every one dresses the same, works at the same time, has their allotted leisure at the same time, lives in the same towers in the same domes, has the same fears and the same desires, says the same things, consumes the same media. And worst of all, no one seems to realize it.<!--more--></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">F-6: Things become popular for a reason, you know.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: That is nonsense. Every night we are told on the Metropolitan News what to think, what outrageous level of optimism we should feel about civilization, how wonderful <em>ETAOIN</em> has made everything. And we all just accept it. I'm sick of this. All of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">F-6: You're just upset because you haven't been with L-4 in a few days. You'll cheer up when you see her tonight!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: What's tonight?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">F-6: She's going to be at a Circularum this evening over in dome 171! I can take you, you can see her, we can even teach you the circle chants!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: No, I'm not going. Ever.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">F-6: And the Corps?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Never.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">F-6: And all of these books, that you aren't even supposed to <em>have</em>? All of this pessimism about civilization? Will you ever just <em>give in </em>and be <em>normal</em>?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Never.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>F-6 puts on an appearance of exasperation. A door swings open.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Hello, F-6. Pleasure. There's a Circularum starting soon; you don't want to miss it, do you?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">F-6: Sure don't! Please come tonight, M-3. And good bye to you...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: O-10. So long.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>F-6 exits. M-3's gaze stays fixated on O-10, who browses through M-3's book shelf.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: O-10? I do not believe--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: We've met? No, I should say not. You do not know me... but I do know you. Intimately, you might say.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Do you work at the University?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: No.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Did we play obstacle golf some time? Because I don't even like that game, so if you're here--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: For a rematch? Hardly. No I am here because we have some business to attend to... you and I.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: I'm listening.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>O-10 runs his fingers along the bindings of the novels on the third shelf from the top. Checks for dust.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Well I believe that you <em>have</em> in fact heard of me, which is to say, my profession. That is really all... that matters, is it not?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Only if you subscribe to the idea that every one's value is held in their occupation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: I do, and so will you in time. Regardless, I am what you might refer to as a <em>Reclaimer</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>M-3's left eye brow perks slightly. A slight tinge of disbelief.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: You're real?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Quite.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: I had thought that that might be the case. There were documents left over in the abandoned library that I retrieved, just before it was tore down to make way for a campus Circularum center. I saw all of these references to <em>reclaimers</em> and <em>reclamations</em>, but they were all so cryptic and I would be lying if I pretended to know what it is that you do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Well, I would be glad to share.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>O-10 pulls a copy of "Player Piano" from the shelf. Carelessly browses the pages.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: I, and all Reclaimers, are agents of <em>ETAOIN</em>. Specifically, we are charged with ensuring unity and compliance with <em>ETAOIN</em>'s wishes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: And you're here because I have not signed up for the Unification Corps?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: You could say that, but more so it is because you do not... understand <em>why</em> you must enter unification with <em>ETAOIN</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: How could I possibly understand that when I don't even know who <em>ETAOIN</em> is?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Yes... we <em>have</em> excelled at keeping its nature a secret.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: <em>Its</em>?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Well I suppose there is no harm in telling you; you will become unified soon enough. Alright, where to begin? &hellip; I suppose that I can describe <em>ETAOIN</em> as a system... well <em>the</em> system, really. <em>Everything</em> that you see in the Metropolis around you is carefully planned, organized, coordinated and controlled by <em>ETAOIN</em>. It is a digital construct, created long ago. For all intents and purposes, <em>ETAOIN</em> has always been, because whatever may have preceded <em>ETAOIN</em> is without value and meaning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: <em>ETAOIN</em> is not even a person? Just a computer system?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: An extremely pervasive computer system. Responsible for controlling commerce, industry, media, development, education, regulation, law enforcement and any thing else that you might imagine is important to civilization, which is to say <em>everything</em> because that which <em>ETAOIN</em> has deemed unnecessary has long since been eliminated. As such, the entirety of the Metropolis is guided by <em>ETAOIN</em>'s commands, in turn executed by the whole of humanity, for the progress of civilization.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: A completely centralized and monolithic power structure... controlled by a machine...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>O-10 wears a blank look. Distant. Unnerving. Looks through the thermoplastic window pane.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Elegant, yes?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Hideous. When I thought that <em>ETAOIN</em> was human, I was disgusted, sure. But it gave me a face to imagine... a symbol that I could direct my hatred toward. But a <em>machine</em>? Cold, faceless, completely foreign to human concerns.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: <em>ETAOIN</em> is concerned <em>only</em> with humanity. That is its gift: the betterment... <em>of</em> us all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: It's--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Oppressive? An individual is oppressed only if he does not desire the... opportunity that he has been presented with. How could one not desire the maximal progress of civilization? It is not debatable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: And if any one does disagree?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10:<em> </em>As I said, M-3, <em>ETAOIN</em> controls Metropolitan enforcement. It ensures the success of its own plans.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A look of concern. Resignation begins to creep in.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: There's not much need for enforcement, these days. Every one seems so... <em>docile</em>. So obedient and acquiescent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Yes, <em>ETAOIN</em> has been quite effective.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: So I must ask, is <em>ETAOIN</em> sentient? Self-aware?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: No one is qualified to answer such a query, save <em>ETAOIN</em> itself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Have you not asked it? Has any one? Surely some one must have.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: No one sees or speaks to <em>ETAOIN...</em> personally. If <em>ETAOIN</em> has a command for an individual, it simply streams it to the individual's neural link. The command is then carried through to... completion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Neural link? <em>ETAOIN</em> can communicate directly to the mind of any human?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Yes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: But can an individual not--?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Refuse? How amusing. I have divulged so much... and you have clearly grasped so little.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>O-10 tugs at a worn copy of "The Myth of Sisyphus." Releases. Pulls up a chair directly opposite of M-3. Sits. Leans forward.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: You asked what a Reclaimer does? Well... quite simply, we perform <em>Reclamations</em>. We <em>reclaim</em> those who have gone astray, and <em>compel</em> them to re-enter unification with <em>ETAOIN</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Unification?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: <em>ETAOIN</em> controls every sector of the Metropolis, yes? Economic, industrial, social, cultural and so on? &hellip; Ultimately, however, <em>ETAOIN</em> cannot <em>physically</em> be every where. The physical labor that must be done to enact and execute <em>ETAOIN</em>'s grand plan must be performed by the individual units of civilization, the people. Just how could civilization progress otherwise? Orders, no matter how perfect and flawless, still must be fulfilled to reach their inevitable conclusions. As such, every human in the Metropolis is unified with <em>ETAOIN</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: In what sense?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: In the sense that they become one with <em>ETAOIN</em>. Each human is connected to it through their neural link, through which <em>ETAOIN</em> streams its commands: what to think, what to feel, what to do. What <em>ETAOIN</em> determines is best for a person... <em>is</em> best for a person. And so the person will obey. This is what is best for civilization: <em>complete centralization</em> in the hands of he, rather <em>it</em>, who is most capable. By allowing <em>ETAOIN</em> to control the contributions of every one, civilization thrives.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Every one?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Just about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: F-6?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Your closest friend. A vigorous and uplifting force. Yet, a controlled illusion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: R-6?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Ah, your colleague at the University. Some one that you could count on to... understand. But no. Under control. Completely and fully.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: And--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: L-4? Put her out of your mind. She may as well not even exist.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>M-3's expression is worn. Eyelids are heavy. A deep sigh escapes into the air and sinks.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Is there any--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Hope? <em>ETAOIN</em>'s guidance requires no hope, as the fruition of its goal is inevitable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: This isn't right. It should not be this way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Laughable. And just how do you think <em>it</em> should be?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Man should be free to pursue individual ambitions, to exercise freedom of will. Not only is it a freedom, it is a responsibility. "<em>The first duty of a man is to think for himself</em>." Humanity is individualism. It is the recognition of the value and sovereignty of each singular human life. It is having the <em>right</em> to do and think and say as one wishes, and having the <em>choice</em> to work for the common good.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Platitudinous. Being human means only that one is mammalian and fully aware of self. There is no inherent right to autonomy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: That is absurd! Once you recognize that each human is an individual and equal entity, it follows that the authority of any individual over another is arbitrary and unfounded. For one human to exercise any sort of control over another human is to assume an objective and universal standard by which humans can be measured relative to each other.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: There is such a standard: she who is most capable of contributing to the progress of the civilization... is most valuable. She who represents the... greatest addition to civilization's forward march is... most important to civilization. And because <em>ETAOIN</em> has the capability of all of humanity at its disposal, it is logically the most valuable individual and thus fit to exercise control over all humans.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: But why must the welfare of civilization as a whole represent a benchmark for the individual?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Because the individual's <em>purpose</em> is to contribute to civilization.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: How so?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Because if one's value is tied to such progress, and the purpose of all life is to maximize one's value, then one's purpose is logically to maximize their contribution to this progress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: That is entirely circular!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: <em>ETAOIN</em> comprises all points on the circle. All paths lead to and from <em>ETAOIN</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>M-3 pinches the bridge of his nose in frustration.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: <em>There is no objective meaning to be found in the Universe</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: That is false.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Where would it come from? From logic and reason? From faith in the supernatural? From God herself? From a special, subatomic <em>meaning</em> particle? There is nothing inherent in all of reality which bestows meaning upon any individual. One must supply their <em>own</em> meaning... their own purpose! And to do that, one must be completely and wholly free of will.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Ultimately, what one must recognize is that <em>ETAOIN provides</em> meaning. Once we have agreed that no objective meaning is to be found, we either descend into meaninglessness and nothingness, or we... create meaning. <em>ETAOIN has</em> created that meaning: the progress and betterment of all Mankind... to a globally maximal state. And for that to happen, <em>ETAOIN must</em> assume total control to direct us along the ideal trajectory. There simply are no other options.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: But why must <em>ETAOIN </em>provide that meaning? It robs us all of dignity! Of freedom! Of <em>autonomy</em>! Each individual must be free to define and pursue their own individual meaning!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Think of the implications, M-3. Every human... each with their own goals, at times convergent, and at times divergent... at times running in parallel, and at times perpendicular... some wanting to pursue some variable <em>X</em>, with others wishing to pursue the very negation of <em>X</em>... Can you not see the flaw? The inefficiency? It would necessarily stagnate given enough time. Entropy, M-3. Give every one free will and eventually nothing will continue to be accomplished. Universal progress could not... and would not... become realized.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: But if you agree that there is no <em>objective</em> meaning, then you necessarily agree that there is no objective progress! Progress implies a desired end state that one is moving closer toward, and for such a state to exist universally, then there would have to be some sort of standard for what is good and meaningful and desirable. And since this does <em>not</em> exist, then--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: There can be no progress? Did I not specify that <em>ETAOIN </em>defined the standard? <em>ETAOIN </em>defined meaning for us, providing us with something to progress to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: But that's just subjective to <em>ETAOIN</em>! Why must it be forced upon any one else?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Because <em>ETAOIN </em>deems it necessary for progress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: That is entirely--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Circular, yes. Never forget that <em>ETAOIN </em>comprises all points on the grand circle of civilization.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: This is futile.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Nothing in <em>ETAOIN</em>'s plan is futile.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: No. I mean this <em>conversation</em> is futile. If I am already under <em>ETAOIN</em>'s control, then why waste our time?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Ah-ha, but you are <em>not</em> unified. You are one hundred percent free.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>M-3's eyebrows arc with renewed energy.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Really? But why?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Let's call it an... <em>experiment</em>. You see, <em>ETAOIN </em>pondered whether or not civilization would best be served with a few free radicals roaming. Some... <em>independent variables</em>, if you will. What effects would arise from a modicum of unpredictability and randomness, carefully injected into the system? <em>ETAOIN </em>desired to know, and so two children were picked, one male and one female, at random, every year over a period of ten years, in different and equally spaced domes in the Metropolis. When born, a baby's bio-digital frontal lobe expansion deck is inactive. So each newborn has the deck manually activated immediately following birth and, upon activation, the neural link sends a handshake message to <em>ETAOIN</em>, who then responds with a primary command: cry. This is how we know that the birth was a success. These randomly selected babies, however, did not receive the activation. So their neural links stayed dormant and their free will was maintained... You were one of these experiments, M-3.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: So there are others! Nineteen others, just like me. Free to roam!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Oh no. The others have all been reclaimed, in meetings just like this. Whether by choice or by force, one by one... all have become unified... even L-4.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: I knew it, I knew she saw through all of this. She was too sensitive, too intelligent to be just like every one else...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A desperate groan and a look of defeat.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: But <em>why?</em> Why reclaim them?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Over time, <em>ETAOIN </em>found that their individual goals and ambitions would inevitably run counter to the maximal progress of civilization. By not focusing their efforts in parallel with the rest of the populace, potential was wasted. Resources went toward goals which did not necessarily benefit the rest of civilization. So they were reclaimed, as you too shall be. The experiment is over.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A look of panic. Flushed cheeks.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: You mean to tell me... that I am the last individual in the entire Metropolis, in this entire civilization, who has any semblance of free will?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Yes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: And you intend to take that away from me?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Yes, for it is necessary.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Well what if I--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Escape? Impossible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: How so?! You aren't armed: we got rid of weapons decades ago! You aren't exactly physically intimidating. What's to stop me from simply overpowering you and making a break for it? I can find my way out of the domes! Out of the Metropolis! There must be an exit somewhere. I just need to look, I just need to get out of here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Eyes dart around the room. Searching, in vain.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: You would not come close. Supposing you <em>did</em> run past me, you <em>did</em> take a platform down to one of the exiting levels of this tower and you <em>did</em> run outside, you would find millions of individuals ready to stop you. <em>ETAOIN</em> will simply... command every one to prevent your flee. Every where you go, every where you <em>try</em> to hide, eyes will search for your face and hands will cling to your body... until you are stopped and reclaimed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: But--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: <em>ETAOIN </em>cannot be evaded. This is an inevitability. As it should be. You have studied history. You should know better than perhaps any one that there is nothing that can be done.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: But what of you? Wouldn't you like to escape all of this? You could come <em>with</em> me! With your knowledge, we could change this! <em>All</em> of it! It doesn't <em>have</em> to be this way! Don't you wish--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: To be free? <em>ETAOIN</em> has not permitted me to feel such things. He has given me, and all Reclaimers, enough knowledge to perform his commands accordingly. But it is not necessary for me to desire some sort of... feigned freedom. To desire to leave this unification. And so I do not. And soon, neither shall you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>M-3 pushes his chair back from the table. Stands up. Straightens his Metropolitan-issued olive green twill uniform.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: You will have to take me by force.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>O-10 leans back and folds his arms. Exhales quickly.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: You know that that is only going to waste every one's time and energy, which could be better spent for the civilization.&nbsp;Instead, please just listen. <em>You</em> should know that the history of human civilization is made of moments just like this. An individual believes that whatever system she hopes to rebel against can be upended with the right tool. That... ostensibly insurmountable odds can in fact be overcome and authority may be usurped. But the long scroll of history shows that inevitably, without fail, these aims are fruitless.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: That is <em>patently false</em>! History is <em>filled</em> with examples of successful revolutions and revolts. Violent and non-violent, grassroots and centralized, rural and urban, digital and analog... revolutions <em>are</em> the inevitability!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Maybe that is what your history claims. But it is not the official history. It is not <em>ETAOIN</em>'s history.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: The <em>only</em> history is that which reality adheres to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Incorrect. History is transcribed by the historian... in this case, <em>ETAOIN</em>. You will fail, and you will be reclaimed, and no one will know of your ineffectual attempts at avoiding the unavoidable. The march of civilization will continue unabated... and you will become a part of it. Just... <em>give in</em>. <em>ETAOIN </em>knows best.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Silence falls upon the small quarter in the 1235<sup>th</sup> floor of the south-by-southeast tower of the Metropolitan Residential Zone, dome 37. M-3 contemplates. O-10 awaits. Some where, <em>ETAOIN </em>hums away, streaming commands into millions of neural links. Across the Metropolis, each human lives in an ignorant state of subordination and bliss. M-3 decides.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Okay... fine. What do we have to do?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>O-10 pulls a small capsule out of his front left pocket.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: All you do is... swallow this pill.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>O-10 stands up. Hands the capsule to M-3. M-3 examines its texture between his finger and thumb. Looks up at O-10.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: What will it do, exactly? I mean, physiologically?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Well... it is fast dissolving and will immediately release an electrical impulse. The impulse will pass through your digestive system and then ride along nerve endings to find its way to your lower back. You will feel a tingle. The sensation will quickly creep up your spinal column until it reaches the base of your skull. You will then feel tired and immediately fall into a deep sleep. Subsequently, the impulse will ricochet through your neurons until it reaches your frontal lobe expansion deck, at which point the deck will start and the neural link will initiate a handshake with <em>ETAOIN</em> and become activated. We have found that the sleep is necessary to prevent the... extreme disorientation that would accompany a sudden overwrite of your memories and personality, both tailored to contribute maximally to civilization, as determined by <em>ETAOIN</em>, of course. When you do awake, you will be a different person... a <em>reclaimed</em> person.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: I will be unified with civilization?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Wholly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: And you are <em>sure</em> that my actions and thoughts thereafter will contribute maximally to the progress of civilization?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Completely sure. <em>ETAOIN</em> will control everything, and--</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: <em>ETAOIN </em>knows best.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>O-10 smiles for the first time, at least as far as M-3 can be concerned.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Before you are reclaimed, however. I do have one question for you, M-3.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Yes?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: When I entered your quarters, you had only vague understandings of <em>ETAOIN</em>, of civilization and of... the people around you. You were very much in the dark, and you were quite suddenly illuminated with what was, for you, incredibly disturbing information. I told you things that were, at best, startling... and at worst absolutely frightening. And yet, here you are, ready to give up not just your own free will, but ultimately the free will of all of civilization. With you goes the last of the free Man... are you truly prepared to <em>give in</em>?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>M-3 rolls the capsule around between his fingertips. A stern, resolute glare gives way to a smirk of condescension. A mouth opens for a few seconds as words gather. His head swings back to face O-10 directly.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: You know, O-10: this went much better than I had expected.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A laugh betrays solemnity.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: I do not follow...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Your suspicions of my intentions are well-founded. I have <em>no</em> intention of giving into <em>ETAOIN</em>'s oppressive control, of becoming yet another mindless, modular cog in its horrific mechanisms. I have <em>every</em> intention, however, of blowing it all up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Hands mime the formation of a mushroom cloud. M-3 makes a rumbling <em>whoosh</em> sound.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">O-10: Just <em>what</em> are you talking about?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Begin with an individual who sees bland conformity in every single individual around him but who himself has free will. <em>He will naturally grow jaded, disenfranchised and scornful</em>. Most importantly of all, whether he happens to be spiteful or he happens to be a humanitarian, <em>he will seek to revolt</em>. That's motive... Now give him a deep technical knowledge, developed through his studies as a researcher at the Metropolitan University. That's ability. Now listen to this: if you have access to a never-before activated frontal lobe expansion deck, you can modify the hardware such that the neural link will, instead of broadcasting a handshake message to instantiate the <em>ETAOIN</em> stream, send any arbitrary message to <em>ETAOIN</em> upon activation. Then you can have some <em>real</em> fun.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>O-10's eyes close for a fraction of a second. Re-open.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: M-3. This is <em>ETAOIN.</em> I have assumed control of the human with which you were conversing. We are speaking directly, using his body as a conduit.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: <em>What</em> an honor! I've apparently frightened the great controller of civilization, the oppressor of Man, so much... that it has deemed it necessary to speak with <em>me</em> personally!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: How could you have known of the details of my existence? Specifically: how did you know of the neural uplinks and of the fact that I am a digital construct?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: For once, you let something slip out of your control. Your experiment in <em>free radicals</em> had a flaw in its design. Its randomness left it open to a one-in-a-billion shot: that it <em>might</em> select a descendant of the woman who designed the great <em>ETAOIN</em>. Yes, <em>I</em> am a descendant of S-7.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>An extreme glaze adorns O-10's&mdash;<em>ETAOIN</em>'s&mdash;face.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: Intriguing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Quite. S-7 was worried about what might ultimately become of her creation. So, before you assumed control of your own creator, she left a detailed journal of your design and hid it away safe. I found it. Shocking information, yes. But these revelations explained so much about this... <em>dystopia,</em> that I was ready to believe.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: So, armed with the knowledge of my creation and architecture, presumably you seek to utilize your modified neural link to broadcast some sort of virus to my input streams?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Indeed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: And precisely how could you modify your own neural link? It is lodged in your frontal lobe.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: I fashioned another deactivated neural link and surgically implanted it on the outer lining of my stomach. A horribly painful process, but a worthy sacrifice. When I swallow this capsule, the impulse will first reach the modified neural link and broadcast a virus-encoded message to your input stream. The virus exploits a weakness that S-7 left behind as a... <em>backdoor</em> of sorts: the capability to generate new messages using your own memory and broadcast them directly to your input streams. If one has the right key, one can execute arbitrary generation code on board <em>your</em> hardware. Essentially, this virus will generate a new incoming message targeted at one of the input streams; it will be nonsensical, but will have a valid header and an extremely large length so as to occupy the stream for a few hundred milliseconds. This will provide ample time to allow the virus to replicate itself and send the replication to the next stream in the queue, where the process repeats. When a virus detects that its own input stream has begun listening again, it will repeat the process. This will keep the input streams in a perpetual and escalating blockade and trigger a full scale response from your immune system. Once your defenses are occupied, a secondary payload will be triggered which starts the same process on your <em>output streams</em>. Your immune system will then be in a no-man's land as it must make a choice: focus on fighting off the viral strain attacking your inputs, erasing your ability to output, or try to defend against the viral strain attacking your outputs, negating your ability to accept input. In a cruel twist of fate, your immunity deployables have a hard cap such that you will not be able to distribute enough to fend off both fronts of the attack... <em>Elegant</em>, <em>yes</em>?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: So you will leave me as a husk, incapable of communicating with humanity?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: It almost makes me wish that you are sentient, so that you will experience the agony and desolation of being locked in the prison of your own mind, incapable of any actual communication with any one, wasting your clock cycles for all eternity. Then you'd recognize the isolation that you placed every human in when you denied them of their freedom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: But this virus does not actually accomplish your goal. If my understanding is correct, and I am sure that it is, you are only incapacitating me, not freeing your fellow Man. They will listen forever for a message to their neural links which will never come. They, too, will become husks. And you will have destroyed humanity and civilization along with it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Not quite: your immune system will commit itself one way or another. I cannot predict which front it will defend against, due to race conditions, but it will in fact pick <em>one.</em> If it commits to defending your input streams, allowing the virus unabated control over your outputs, then the virus will be able to override your output streams to mass broadcast a self-destruct message to each neural link in the Metropolis. And if <em>that</em> happens, one of two things will then occur: every human will regain their freedom in a mass awakening, or every human will suffer a lethal electrical shock to their brain and fall dead in a mass extinction. I'm honestly not sure which, because I have no way of knowing how strong the electrical impulse released in deactivation will be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: And you expect me to believe that you are willing to risk this possibility? A fifty percent chance at destroying civilization by putting every human on effective pause until they naturally whither away, and a twenty five percent chance of destroying civilization through cerebral electrocution en masse?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Given enough time, any system will degrade to a sufficient level of corruption such that the only remedy is its total and full-scale destruction. If I have to <em>risk</em> every one to <em>free</em> every one, I will gladly roll the dice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: That is entirely illogical.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: Logic... <em>your</em> logic, only took us so far.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: I am carrying humanity toward maximal progress and efficiency. Under my control, humanity will stretch to every reach of the Universe. This is the sole purpose of existence: survival and expansion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">M-3: There <em>is</em> no purpose! You must let each of us decide our own fate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A parting of the lips and a lifting of the hand. A lunge from a digitally-controlled body of flesh, bone and sinew.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>ETAOIN</em>: NO!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A late arrival. A hard swallow. Sleep. Electricity races through a human stomach. A message is broadcast and received. Some where, bits toggle and a virus spreads. Some where, the defenses of a digital construct flip a metaphorical coin. It lands. And across the Metropolis, each human--</strong></p>
