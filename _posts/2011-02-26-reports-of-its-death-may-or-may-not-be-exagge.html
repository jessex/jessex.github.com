<p>I was browsing TechCrunch earlier today, which is an activity that I do less and less due to its decreasing quality. But that is an entirely different story. I came across this MG Siegler piece on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/25/os-x-lion-death-of-cd/" title="The Future Solidifies: OS X Lion Really Will Maul The CD (And All Other Discs)">the death of optical media at the hands of OS X Lion</a> and, after digging into it, sort of agreed with some of his points for once. More on that later. What I really would like to focus on right now is the title:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>The Future Solidifies: OS X Lion Really Will Maul The CD (And All Other&nbsp;Discs)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the title expresses a great certainty that all optical media are going to die at the hands of OS X Lion. In other words, they will be DEAD. All of them. All discs. This is an admittedly tame example of a disturbing tendency of editors and writers to give technologies their premature obituaries. It seems that almost every day now, a quick trip around your typical tech-oriented sites and blogs will yield at least one article which uses shoddy research, strenuous connections between disjointed concepts and a plethora of logical fallacies to alert the masses that an important [company/technology/application/whatever] is now <strong><em>officially</em></strong> gone, or at least circling the drain.<!--more--></p>
<p>Harry McCracken pretty hilariously <a href="http://technologizer.com/2010/08/18/the-tragic-death-of-practically-everything/" title="The Tragic Death of Practically Everything">recaps this trend</a> by pointing toward a number of these pieces. According to esteemed members of the tech world, Internet Explorer is dead via Microsoft-assisted suicide, Microsoft itself is dead (because Web 2.0 has conditioned us to believe such a thing), Microsoft Office is dead (oof, Mr. Gillmor, oof), OpenOffice is dead, email is dead, RSS is dead (Gillmor, again), Flash is dead (everyone who has ever written anything has said this, so expect my article early next week), Facebook is dead (right below the headline for that article was a Facebook "Like" button, hilariously enough), Twitter is dead, Firefox is dead, the iPod is dead because of general purpose devices, the Mac is dead because of Intel, TV is dead because of streaming video (who hasn't seen this one?), the desktop and the netbook are both dead, the e-reader is dead and (almost inexplicably) the Wii is dead. And don't forget: <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/08/ff_webrip/all/1" title="Thanks, Wired">the Web is dead</a>.</p>
<p>So as you can see, there's really nothing left; what a <em>wasteland</em> we have turned our world into! Thankfully, it's almost always untrue.</p>
<p>The problem, as I see it, is manifold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monetization, advertising and commercialism have turned online journalistic endeavors into a factory where the only things that matter are ad impressions, unique visitors and the Almighty Click and you end up with things like "The AOL Way"</li>
<li>The Internet provides everyone with a soapbox, so to get anyone's attention you have to be a tad radicalized</li>
<li>The people making these link-bait headlines have become so insulated within the tech spheres that they assume that the exodus of some elite, tech-savvy demographic and subsequent early adoption of a competitor means that the rest of the general population will follow suit</li>
<li>Similarly, they often make the faulty assumption that just because an up-and-coming competitor is generally superior, it will become the dominant player</li>
<li>Finally, our old friend self-interest: the author has realized that he no longer has a need for some product or service or the products and services of some company and projects this realization onto his audience</li>
</ul><p/>
<p>Simple examination of the aforementioned examples shows the inevitable wrongness of such statements. Sure, some of these supposedly dead technologies are indeed trending downward. And sure, to those of us who do tend to flock toward the "next big thing," many of the above are cringe-worthy (Internet Explorer?!). But they are all alive and kicking, in some capacity or another. I am not one to triumphantly carry the torch of popularity as a meaningful metric; but in these matters, you need to at least <em>look</em> at the numbers.</p>
<p>This entire situation bears a stark similarity to the also presently occurring trend to phrase headlines as questions, which I believe is happening for the very same reasons. And both are awful. So as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_Law_of_Headlines" title="Betteridge's Law of Headlines">Betteridge did before me</a>, I too will theorize:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>Essex's Law of Headlines states that "any headline which proclaims that, or asks if, a technology or company is dead is remarkably incorrect."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I'm just realistic enough to realize that I cannot be absolutely certain about each and every case application of this law. So with that in mind, I will now run the risk of negating everything that I just said by agreeing in part with MG Siegler's proclamation against optical media.</p>
<p>The last time that I myself used any sort of disc was to play a mix tape that a friend had made for me. I do not purchase music or movies via hard copy any more. In fact, the only physical disk that I have actually purchased in recent memory was a video game, and the growing tendency toward downloadable content and downloadable/streaming/in-browser gaming seems to be slowly, slowly eroding at this. For me, and for most people that I have discussed this with, optical media are just sort of unnecessary. It's not that they are poor technology, just redundant. Superfluous. I understand that I am hardly a prototype of the consumerist majority, but I feel confident in saying that just the sheer progress of technology is going to eventually squeeze optical media out of the mainstream.</p>
<p>Channeling my inner Kurzweil here: punch card, magnetic tape, vacuum tube, vinyl, cassette tape, betamax, video game cartridge, VHS and HD-DVD all lost their footing because superior competitors usurped them in a completely natural manner. DVD is being phased out for Blu-ray. HDD is fighting a constant battle against SSD. It just happens. It is an inevitability. Large, bulky form factors yield to sleeker form factors. Analog often yields to digital. Physical in general should eventually yield to the air. It just makes sense. I understand the arguments for physical media: more secure than "the cloud," greater distributability in some use cases (oddly enough), the second-hand market, a greater sense of "authenticity," etc. <em>Heck, I prefer books to ebooks</em>. But I think that the nature of technological progress is such that answers to these arguments will be developed.</p>
<p>I do not see this right around the corner, as in the Summer of 2011 delivered by the claws of an Apple-branded Lion. But eventually. I can wait. In the mean time, I will be whittling my time away with about three fourths of the supposed walking dead; I guess that makes me a philiac of sorts.</p>
