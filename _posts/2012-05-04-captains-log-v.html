<p>This is Captain's Log V. In this edition, I hope to meet all of my goals before a vacation to Europe, and almost make it. <em>Almost</em>.<!--more--></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Captain's Log: May 2012</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Side Projects</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/dashing" title="jessex/dashing - Github">dashing</a></strong>&nbsp;- In April, I wanted to determine if I would continue this project on its current trajectory, pivot it into something greater (or at least <em>different</em>). That determination was made: continue in its current trajectory, but demote the project to the backburner. I do not have a great passion for continuing its development, but do believe that I will want to pick it back up in the future. Until then, it will not be a project that I actively maintain.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/gistacious" title="jessex/gistacious - Github">gistacious</a></strong>&nbsp;- My goal for gistacious for April, as it was for March, was to implement the last layer of the API. Quite frankly, I dropped the ball on this one. There were several times where I thought about getting to work on the project, but it never materialized. As with dashing, I have a Finishing Problem with gistacious: I have many ideas and I can get started on them in earnest, but I lose focus on the homestretch. That will have to be rectified, because I definitely want to push this forward to full functionality.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/CLRS-implementations" title="jessex/CLRS-implementations - Github">CLRS Implementations</a></strong>&nbsp;- I wrote more Lisp implementations, some of which have not been pushed to the repository on Github because I am still attempting to clean up the code (sometimes my Scheme is not as beautiful as it could be). Regardless, mission accomplished. I find that writing Lisp is an absolute joy; some find the "syntax" to be laborious or difficult to work with, but I say that the <em>lack</em> of syntax is absolutely eye-opening. You're essentially writing code in the format of a parse tree: something that would have been mildly frightening to me before picking up Scheme. Ultimately, this is what my overarching goal for the project was: to become comfortable within wider horizons by jumping <em>out</em> of my comfort zone and trying new technologies. <em>It's working</em>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jessex/Eratosthenes" title="jessex/Eratosthenes - Github">Eratosthenes</a></strong>&nbsp;- The goal for Eratosthenes was to clean up the command line argument parsing, which I did. I then had a few stretch goals in mind, which I did not accomplish. Alas, the time simply was not present for this one. I may pick it up in the future and try to hammer those out, but I'm not making any promises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Ventures</strong></p>
<p><strong>W.A.R.E.</strong>&nbsp;- <em>You want more math</em>? <strong>You got it</strong>. The goal to further work on the mathematical underpinnings of the recommendation engine was met, though I do not believe I am anywhere near done with it. However, I might accelerate this project out of "preliminary" status and make it an&nbsp;<em>official</em> side project, because it intrigues me so. Intense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Photography</strong>&nbsp;- The <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Compact-Digital-Cameras/26329/COOLPIX-P510.html" title="Nikon Coolpix P510">elusive camera</a> is mine! Since the acquisition, I have been photographing every thing that I see, much to the probable dismay of people walking down the sidewalk in my neighborhood. That aside, my approach to how I would like to pursue this has changed (at least in terms of "publishing"). Instead of maintaining a Flickr account (which I believe I do not need) and an Instagram (which I know I do not want, after the Facebook acquisition), I will post all of my photographs to my own personal site, which I plan to develop in earnest once I return from vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Writing</strong>&nbsp;- I continued the <em>Stream of Consciousness</em> experiment, more so in its private channel than its public one. I would like to get this wrapped up in the next couple of months, though. There should be plenty of time to wrap it up, at least privately, aboard the myriad of trains and planes which eagerly await in the next two weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: small;">General Comments</strong></p>
<p>With May effectively wiped out of contention as a month of productivity, I had hoped to complete all April goals and cruise through to June with a cleaner slate. Though I admittedly did not have very lofty goals for my projects in April, and though there was admittedly not a plethora to do, I can say that I did come close to meeting this overall aim. gistacious was the lone project to miss out on meeting its April goals, entirely due to my own lack of focus in driving it forward. Hopefully, the next two weeks strolling Europe will give me enough time to decompress and come back fresh.</p>
<p>However, the astute reader may note that I did not set any explicit goals for the month of May. My thinking is that with a return so late in the month, after getting settled back into the flow of life and after getting re-acclimated at work, I will not have the requisite time to devote to any real measure of work. So May will be unproductive along this front.</p>
<p>But I will be in <em>Europe</em>. Gosh dang.</p>
